2020-05-04 13:28:22		Intro from Manish:
2020-05-04 13:28:22		_“Hello Everyone. I am Manish. I have been a software engineer for around 13 years and worked on various different tech stacks, mobile, backend services, digital platforms and domains like travel, banking and consumer products. I consider myself a jack of all trades and master of some! Outside of work, I like to read books (mostly philosophy) and play table tennis. This lockdown, I have been upskilling on life skills; I found out I am more than a decent cook and I can sketch._

2020-05-04 13:28:22		_One thing not many people know about me is that I was a professional gamer during the early times of my career and I was a ranked player in India for Battlefield and Counter-Strike.”_
